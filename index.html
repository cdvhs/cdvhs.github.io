          <h6>With the approaching transition from Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts, we will need to end support for Windows XP and Windows Vista. This will also result in the end of support for the legacy launcher. You can read more about the account migration here -> https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-JAVA-Account-Migration-FAQ</h6>
          <h6>Effective in Q2 2021, we will end support for both platforms and the legacy launcher. Your account and save data will not be impacted by this and you will be able to resume playing if you reach the minimum system requirements.
