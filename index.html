    <h2>
      And all I am is a man<br>
      I want the world in my hands<br>
      I hate the beach<br>
      But I stand in California with my toes in the sand<br>
      Use the sleeves of my sweater<br>
      Let's have an adventure<br>
      Head in the clouds but my gravity centered<br>
      Touch my neck and I'll touch yours<br>
      You in those little high waisted shorts, oh<br>
      Oh, she knows what I think about<br>
      And what I think about<br>
      One love, two mouths<br>
      One love, one house<br>
      No shirt, no blouse<br>
      Just us, you find out<br>
      Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no<br>
      'Cause it's too cold<br>
      For you here<br>
      And now, so let me hold<br>
      Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
      And if I may just take your breath away<br>
      I don't mind if there's not much to say<br>
      Sometimes the silence guides a mind<br>
      To move to a place so far away<br>
      The goosebumps start to raise<br>
      The minute that my left hand meets your waist<br>
      And then I watch your face<br>
      Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah<br>
      These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for<br>
      Inside this place is warm<br>
      Outside it starts to pour<br>
      Coming down<br>
      One love, two mouths<br>
      One love, one house<br>
      No shirt, no blouse<br>
      Just us, you find out<br>
      Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no<br>
      'Cause it's too cold<br>
      For you here<br>
      And now, so let me hold<br>
      Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
      'Cause it's too cold<br>
      For you here<br>
      And now, so let me hold<br>
      Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
      Whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
      Whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
      Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
      Whoa, whoa<br>
      Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
      Whoa, whoa<br>
      'Cause it's too cold<br>
      For you here<br>
      And now, so let me hold<br>
      Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
      It's too cold<br>
      For you here<br>
      And now, let me hold<br>
      Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
      And it's too cold, it's too cold<br>
      The hands of my sweater<br>
